# **Project Description**

**Recognize Handwritten Digits**

This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and image processing, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

**Technologies Used**

- Python: The primary programming language used for the project.

- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning library used for training the neural network.

- Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models.

- Pillow: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, used for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.

- Google Colab: A free cloud service with support for GPU, which allows you to write and execute Python code in the browser.

**Files**

recognize_handwritten_digit.py: This script includes all the necessary steps to build, train, and evaluate the CNN model for handwritten digit recognition. The major steps include:

- Importing libraries and the dataset

- Data preprocessing and normalization

- Building the CNN model architecture

- Compiling the model

- Training the model

- Evaluating the model performance Future Enhancements

 **Future Enhancements**

- Experiment with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

- Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the robustness of the model.

- Deploy the trained model using a web framework to create an interactive web application for handwritten digit recognition.
